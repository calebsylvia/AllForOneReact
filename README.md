# Peer Review: Everything works the way it is intented for and all the numbers have data validation. His website looks great, I like how the theme of the website looks cool. Looking at his code too, I like how everything seems simple, nothing too complex. One minor problem is that when on mobile mode you click on any number challenge and go back to home the text messes up and leaves the box. Overall I would say he did a great job on this project.
